Code to fetch user location

```Swift
import CoreLocation

class LocationFetcher: NSObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    let manager = CLLocationManager()
    var lastKnownLocation: CLLocationCoordinate2D?

    override init() {
        super.init()
        manager.delegate = self
    }

    func start() {
        manager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
        manager.startUpdatingLocation()
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        lastKnownLocation = locations.first?.coordinate
    }
}
```

* To use that, start by adding a new key to __Info.plist__ called “Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description”, then give it some sort of value explaining to the user why you need their location.

```Swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let locationFetcher = LocationFetcher()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Start Tracking Location") {
                self.locationFetcher.start()
            }

            Button("Read Location") {
                if let location = self.locationFetcher.lastKnownLocation {
                    print("Your location is \(location)")
                } else {
                    print("Your location is unknown")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
